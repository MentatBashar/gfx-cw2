Do tasks from top-to-bottom. Tasks have been roughly ordered from easiest to hardest.
Each block should be done before the previous, and each task in a block can be completed in parallel with other tasks in the same block.

* Reimplement simple_mesh so that we aren't accused of stealing it

* Add vmlib tests and document them
X Reimplement all the camera controls so that we aren't accused of stealing them
X Add first-person camera controls
X Add simplfied directional light model
* Add terrain texture

* Load the launchpad 'once' and colour it properly
X Create the custom model of the spaceship

* Do the animation
* Add the tracking cameras

* Add the simple UI elements
* Do the measure performance section

[Stretch]
* Add the second launch pad without duplicating vao
* Add local light sources
* Add particles
* Add split screen


Without the stretch tasks and assuming full marks for completed tasks, this makes for ~37 marks.
