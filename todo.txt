Do tasks from top-to-bottom. Tasks have been roughly ordered from easiest to hardest.
Each block should be done before the previous, and each task in a block can be completed in parallel with other tasks in the same block.

X Reimplement simple_mesh so that we aren't accused of stealing it

* Add vmlib tests and document them
X Reimplement all the camera controls so that we aren't accused of stealing them
X Add first-person camera controls
X Add simplfied directional light model
X Add terrain texture

X Load the launchpads and colour them properly  (Flaw found: when placing and moving camera around, the x-axis are completely opposit, need to fix this)
X Create the custom model of the spaceship

~ Do the animation
* Add the tracking cameras

* Add the simple UI elements
* Do the measure performance section

[Stretch]
* Add local light sources
  X Point Lights
  * Bind three point lights to spaceship
* Add particles
* Add split screen


Without the stretch tasks and assuming full marks for completed tasks, this makes for ~37 marks.
